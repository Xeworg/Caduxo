# Spec: Caduxo Expiry Tracker Requirements

## Capability: First-run setup

### Requirement: first store creation

Caduxo shall require the user to create an initial store/local during first run before expiry lots can be registered.

#### Scenario: no store exists

- Given the app has no stores
- When the user opens Caduxo
- Then the app prompts the user to create the first store/local
- And expiry lot creation is unavailable until a store exists

## Capability: Product catalog

### Requirement: mandatory unique SKU

Caduxo shall require every product to have a non-empty SKU unique within the local database.

#### Scenario: duplicate SKU

- Given a product exists with SKU `ABC-001`
- When the user creates or imports another product with SKU `ABC-001`
- Then the app blocks the duplicate or asks the user to review/update the existing product

### Requirement: multiple barcodes per product

Caduxo shall allow a product to have zero, one, or multiple UPC/EAN/barcode values.

#### Scenario: scanner finds product by barcode

- Given a product has barcode `7501234567890`
- When the user scans `7501234567890` in the scan/search field
- Then the app opens that product or starts an expiry lot entry for that product

### Requirement: barcode uniqueness

Caduxo shall prevent the same barcode from being assigned to more than one product.

### Requirement: UPC attach during product creation

The product creation form MUST expose a UPC/barcode input field that allows the user to attach a barcode to a product without first creating the product and then navigating to the product detail page.

This requirement extends the existing "multiple barcodes per product" capability from after-creation only to also during-creation, while leaving the detail-page Barcodes section as the place to manage more than one barcode per product.

#### Scenario: user attaches UPC during manual product creation

- GIVEN the user is creating a product from the catalog UI in create mode
- WHEN the user enters a UPC value in the create form's Barcodes subsection
- AND submits the form
- THEN the system creates the product via `create_product` first
- AND the system attempts to attach the UPC to the created product via the post-save barcode attach step
- AND the system invokes `onSaved` exactly once once the product exists

#### Scenario: UPC field empty stays the default and quiet path

- GIVEN the user is creating a product
- WHEN the UPC field is empty or trimmed to empty
- THEN the system creates the product
- AND the system MUST NOT invoke any `add_product_barcode` command
- AND no barcode-related UI notice is rendered

#### Scenario: UPC field shape mirrors detail page

- GIVEN the create form is rendered in create mode
- THEN it MUST display a Barcodes subsection containing at minimum:
  - a "Barcode value" text input with placeholder `e.g. 7501234567890`
  - an optional "Type" text input backed by a `<datalist>` offering `EAN13`, `EAN8`, `UPC`, `CODE128`, `CODE39`, `QR`
  - an optional "Set as primary" checkbox (unchecked by default)
- AND the subsection MUST be visually consistent with the Barcodes section on the product detail page
- AND the subsection MUST NOT be rendered in edit mode

### Requirement: non-blocking barcode attach on create

The product creation submit flow MUST treat a barcode attach failure as non-blocking: the new product MUST remain saved and `onSaved` MUST be invoked regardless of the attach outcome, with attach outcomes surfaced via a non-blocking inline notice.

#### Scenario: UPC already attached to another product

- GIVEN the user submitted the create form with a non-empty UPC value
- AND the backend reports the UPC is already attached to a different product
- WHEN the post-save attach step runs
- THEN the system keeps the new product saved
- AND renders an inline notice under the Barcodes subsection stating that the UPC already belongs to another product and was not attached
- AND does not roll back the product creation
- AND does not throw

#### Scenario: UPC already attached to this product

- GIVEN the user submitted the create form with a non-empty UPC value
- AND the backend reports the UPC is already attached to the same product (defensive retry case)
- WHEN the post-save attach step runs
- THEN the system keeps the new product saved
- AND renders an inline notice with the backend message
- AND does not throw

#### Scenario: backend command error during attach

- GIVEN the user submitted the create form with a non-empty UPC value
- WHEN the post-save attach step encounters any other backend error (network, database, schema, validation)
- THEN the system keeps the new product saved
- AND renders the backend message in the inline notice slot
- AND does not roll back the product creation
- AND does not throw

### Requirement: typed barcode attach wrapper for create flow

The frontend MUST provide a wrapper around `add_product_barcode` used during product creation that returns a discriminated result instead of throwing, so the create flow can react to attach outcomes without crashing the product save.

#### Scenario: wrapper result shape on success

- GIVEN the create flow invokes the wrapper with a trimmed non-empty UPC value
- WHEN the backend `add_product_barcode` call succeeds
- THEN the wrapper returns `{ ok: true }`
- AND the wrapper MUST NOT throw

#### Scenario: wrapper result shape on duplicate against another product

- GIVEN the create flow invokes the wrapper
- WHEN the backend rejects the attach because the UPC is already attached to a different product
- THEN the wrapper returns `{ ok: false, kind: "duplicate_other" }`
- AND the wrapper MUST NOT throw
- AND the create flow renders the "already belongs to another product" notice from this result kind

#### Scenario: wrapper result shape on duplicate against the same product

- GIVEN the create flow invokes the wrapper
- WHEN the backend rejects the attach because the UPC is already attached to the same product
- THEN the wrapper returns `{ ok: false, kind: "duplicate_same" }`
- AND the wrapper MUST NOT throw

#### Scenario: wrapper result shape on any other failure

- GIVEN the create flow invokes the wrapper
- WHEN the backend reports any other error (network, database, schema, validation)
- THEN the wrapper returns `{ ok: false, kind: "other", message }` containing the backend message
- AND the wrapper MUST NOT throw

### Requirement: scanner quick-create seeds UPC field

The dashboard scan quick-create path MUST seed the scanned value into the create form's UPC/barcode field, not into the SKU field, when no product matches the scan. UPC and SKU remain independent identifiers; the user types the SKU themselves.

#### Scenario: unmatched scan opens quick-create with UPC pre-fill

- GIVEN the user scans or types a value into the dashboard scan/search field
- AND no product matches that value as a barcode or SKU
- WHEN the quick-create modal opens
- THEN the create form's UPC/barcode field is pre-filled with the scanned value
- AND the SKU field is empty
- AND the user MUST be able to submit the form with the scanned UPC and a typed SKU

#### Scenario: matched scan opens product directly

- GIVEN the user scans or types a value into the dashboard scan/search field
- AND the value matches an existing product by barcode
- WHEN the dashboard handles the scan
- THEN the matched product is opened
- AND no quick-create modal is shown
- AND no UPC attach is attempted

### Requirement: silent barcode helper retired once nothing calls it

The dashboard quick-create path MUST migrate off the silent `addProductBarcodeIfNew` helper to the new typed wrapper, and the silent helper MUST be removed once no production caller remains.

#### Scenario: dashboard quick-create uses typed wrapper

- GIVEN the dashboard opens the quick-create modal after a non-matching scan
- WHEN the create form completes a successful product save with a non-empty UPC
- THEN the form's submit flow uses the typed wrapper to attach the UPC
- AND the create form MUST NOT invoke the silent `addProductBarcodeIfNew` helper

#### Scenario: silent helper removal once obsolete

- GIVEN no production caller invokes the silent `addProductBarcodeIfNew` helper after the migration
- WHEN this change is archived
- THEN the silent helper is removed from `src/lib/products.ts`
- AND no automated test references the silent helper

### Requirement: unit catalog and integer/decimal classification

Caduxo shall expose a typed unit catalog seeded with preset units covering mass, volume, and count families. Each catalog unit SHALL carry a stable `key`, a localized `display_name`, and a `kind` classifier of exactly `integer` or `decimal`. Products may reference a catalog unit via `default_unit_id`; the `kind` of the chosen unit SHALL drive how LotForm's quantity input renders (`step="1"` and `min="1"` for `integer`, `step="0.01"` for `decimal`). Storage of `quantity` SHALL remain `REAL` for both kinds in this slice; lot-level quantity enforcement against `unit_type` is explicitly deferred.

The catalog SHALL support inline custom unit creation from the ProductForm. Renaming a unit's `display_name` SHALL be allowed; archiving a unit SHALL be blocked while any product still references it via `default_unit_id`; re-classifying a unit's `kind` SHALL NOT be exposed in this slice.

Catalog units created inline from the ProductForm SHALL be persisted in the same catalog table and become selectable from any product form from then on. The UI SHALL display the full `display_name` label (not the `key` symbol) in ProductForm, LotForm, the dashboard, reports, the resolve-quantity dialog, the PDF export, and the CSV import preview.

#### Scenario: product picks a preset unit

- GIVEN the catalog contains a preset `kg` with `kind = decimal` and `display_name = "Kilogramo"`
- WHEN the user selects `Kilogramo` from the ProductForm unit datalist
- THEN the product is saved with `default_unit_id` referencing `kg`
- AND `unit_type = decimal` is set on the product
- AND the existing `default_unit` text column on `products` echoes `Kilogramo`

#### Scenario: product creates a custom unit inline

- GIVEN the user types `bandejas` in the ProductForm unit field
- AND `bandejas` is not in the catalog (neither as a preset key nor as an existing custom unit)
- WHEN the user clicks "+ Create new unit" and confirms with `kind = integer`
- THEN a new `unit_definitions` row is created with `key = "bandejas"` and `display_name = "bandejas"`
- AND the product is saved with `default_unit_id` referencing the new unit
- AND `unit_type = integer` is set on the product
- AND the new unit becomes selectable from the ProductForm unit datalist of any other product afterwards

#### Scenario: integer unit drives LotForm quantity input

- GIVEN a product has `unit_type = integer`
- WHEN the user opens the lot entry form for that product
- THEN the `quantity` input renders with `step="1"` and `min="1"`
- AND the resolved unit label displayed alongside the input is the catalog unit's `display_name`

#### Scenario: decimal unit drives LotForm quantity input

- GIVEN a product has `unit_type = decimal`
- WHEN the user opens the lot entry form for that product
- THEN the `quantity` input renders with `step="0.01"` and `min="0.01"`
- AND the resolved unit label displayed alongside the input is the catalog unit's `display_name`

#### Scenario: unrecognized legacy units are surfaced without rewriting

- GIVEN a pre-existing product has `default_unit = "kg."` (typo) and `default_unit_id IS NULL` after the catalog migration
- WHEN the user opens the dashboard after upgrade
- THEN a non-blocking banner shows the count of unrecognized units with a "Review" action
- AND the existing `default_unit` text on the product is NOT rewritten
- AND the product's `default_unit_id` remains NULL
- AND the user can navigate to a review page that lists each unrecognized `raw_value` with options to map it to a catalog preset, create a custom unit from it, or leave it for later

#### Scenario: banner dismissal persists until a new unrecognized value appears

- GIVEN the dashboard banner was dismissed after the user reviewed all current unrecognized units
- AND the dismissed signature was persisted to `app_settings.unit_audit.dismissed_signature`
- WHEN the user opens the dashboard on a subsequent launch with no new unrecognized values introduced
- THEN the banner is hidden because the current signature matches the persisted signature
- AND if a new unrecognized unit is introduced (for example via a new product or a CSV import), the banner reappears because the signature changes

#### Scenario: CSV preview flags unknown units without blocking the import

- GIVEN a CSV row contains `default_unit = "litross"` (typo)
- WHEN the user previews the import
- THEN the row's status includes `UnknownUnit` with the raw value and up to 3 suggested catalog keys
- AND the row renders a non-blocking per-row badge in the preview
- AND the import still commits (warn-and-continue): the resulting product is saved with `default_unit = "litross"`, `default_unit_id = NULL`, and surfaces in the audit banner after the import lands

## Capability: Categories

### Requirement: editable category list

Caduxo shall provide a user-editable category list for product classification.

#### Scenario: category filter

- Given products are assigned to categories
- When the user filters by category
- Then dashboard/report lists show only matching products/lots

## Capability: Expiry lots

### Requirement: lot registration

Caduxo shall allow users to register expiry lots linked to a product.

Required lot fields:

- product
- quantity
- unit — the resolved free-text label displayed on the lot. When the product references a catalog unit via `default_unit_id`, the value SHALL be the catalog unit's `display_name`. When no catalog unit is set, the value SHALL be the legacy `products.default_unit` text, or, if that is empty, the seeded `units` preset's `display_name` (`Unidades`). The lot form SHALL render the `unit` field as a read-only chip when the product has a catalog unit, and SHALL keep it editable for legacy lots whose product has `unit_type = null`.
- expiry date
- alert days before expiry

Conditionally required:

- store/local when multiple stores exist

Optional:

- internal location
- batch/lot code
- notes

(Previously: the `unit` field was listed as a free-text label with no note about catalog-driven resolution or about how the value falls back when no catalog unit is selected.)

### Requirement: product default alert days

Caduxo shall suggest 30 alert days when creating a product, but the user must confirm or change the product default.

### Requirement: lot alert override

Caduxo shall pre-fill lot alert days from the product default and allow the user to override the value for that specific lot.

### Requirement: partial resolution

Caduxo shall allow users to resolve part of a lot quantity and keep the remaining quantity active.

#### Scenario: partial quantity resolved

- Given an active lot has quantity 10
- When the user resolves 4 units
- Then the app records 4 units as resolved
- And the active lot remains with quantity 6

## Capability: Stores and locations

### Requirement: multi-store support

Caduxo shall allow users to create multiple stores/locales.

### Requirement: implicit single store

Caduxo shall not force store selection during lot creation when only one store exists.

### Requirement: optional internal locations

Caduxo shall allow users to create optional internal locations inside stores and assign them to lots.

## Capability: Dashboard

### Requirement: operational main screen

Caduxo shall provide a dashboard focused on expiry actions.

It shall include:

- expired lots
- lots expiring today
- lots inside alert window
- next 30 days
- scan/search field
- store filter

The dashboard SHALL also surface two additional quick-filter buttons in its filter bar: "Next 7 days" and "All". Each named section in the list above MUST correspond to the row set defined for the matching quick-filter button in the `Dashboard quick-filter buttons return promised rows` requirement; activating the matching button MUST return exactly that section's rows.

(Previously: the dashboard listed four sections by name without specifying the exact row set per section or the existence of the "Next 7 days" and "All" buttons.)

#### Scenario: dashboard sections align with the matching filter buttons

- GIVEN the dashboard is loaded with no preset active
- WHEN the user activates each of the six filter buttons in turn
- THEN the row set displayed for "Expired" matches the expired-lots section
- AND the row set displayed for "Today" matches the lots-expiring-today section
- AND the row set displayed for "Alert window" matches the lots-inside-alert-window section
- AND the row set displayed for "Next 30 days" matches the next-30-days section
- AND the row set displayed for "Next 7 days" is the seven-day subset of "Next 30 days"
- AND the row set displayed for "All" is the unfiltered active-lot set

### Requirement: expired visibility

Caduxo shall show expired lots prominently until they are resolved or archived.

### Requirement: Dashboard quick-filter buttons return promised rows

The Dashboard quick-filter bar SHALL provide six buttons in the fixed order `All`, `Expired`, `Today`, `Alert window`, `Next 7 days`, `Next 30 days`. For each button, the dashboard's `lots` array MUST contain exactly the active lots whose enriched row satisfies the corresponding predicate below. The predicate is computed from the row's `days_remaining` (an `i64` day count where `< 0` means expired, `0` means today, `> 0` means future) and `alert_days_before` (an `i32`). The repository continues to enforce `WHERE el.status = 'active'`, so resolved and archived lots are not in scope regardless of preset.

| Button | Predicate on the enriched row |
|---|---|
| `All` | `true` (no additional filter; the row is already active) |
| `Expired` | `row.days_remaining < 0` |
| `Today` | `row.days_remaining == 0` |
| `Alert window` | `row.days_remaining >= 0 && row.alert_days_before > 0 && row.days_remaining <= row.alert_days_before as i64` |
| `Next 7 days` | `row.days_remaining >= 0 && row.days_remaining <= 7` |
| `Next 30 days` | `row.days_remaining >= 0 && row.days_remaining <= 30` |

The predicates are intentionally independent ranges. A row may satisfy zero, one, or several predicates. Each button is its own filter.

#### Scenario: All returns every active lot

- GIVEN active lots with `days_remaining` in `{-2, 0, 5, 31}`
- WHEN the user activates the "All" button
- THEN the dashboard lists every active lot
- AND the row set is identical to the unfiltered repository result for the same store/location filters

#### Scenario: Expired returns only lots past their expiry date

- GIVEN active lots with `days_remaining` in `{-2, 0, 5}`
- WHEN the user activates the "Expired" button
- THEN the dashboard lists only the lot with `days_remaining = -2`
- AND lots with `days_remaining >= 0` are NOT listed

#### Scenario: Today returns only lots expiring today

- GIVEN active lots with `days_remaining` in `{-1, 0, 1}`
- WHEN the user activates the "Today" button
- THEN the dashboard lists only the lot with `days_remaining = 0`

#### Scenario: Alert window includes lots inside their configured window including today

- GIVEN active lots with `(days_remaining, alert_days_before)` of `(0, 14)`, `(10, 30)`, `(25, 30)`, and `(-1, 14)`
- WHEN the user activates the "Alert window" button
- THEN the dashboard lists the lots with `days_remaining` in `{0, 10, 25}`
- AND the expired lot with `days_remaining = -1` is NOT listed
- AND a lot with `days_remaining = 0` and `alert_days_before = 14` IS listed

#### Scenario: Alert window excludes lots with no configured alert window

- GIVEN an active lot with `days_remaining = 5` and `alert_days_before = 0`
- WHEN the user activates the "Alert window" button
- THEN the lot is NOT listed
- AND a lot with `days_remaining = 5` and `alert_days_before = 6` IS listed

#### Scenario: Next 7 days returns lots within seven calendar days inclusive

- GIVEN active lots with `days_remaining` in `{0, 5, 7, 8, 25}`
- WHEN the user activates the "Next 7 days" button
- THEN the dashboard lists only the lots with `days_remaining` in `{0, 5, 7}`
- AND a lot with `days_remaining = 25` is NOT listed even when its `alert_days_before` is `30`

#### Scenario: Next 30 days includes alert-window lots that expire within 30 days

- GIVEN an active lot with `days_remaining = 20` and `alert_days_before = 14` (which classifies as the `alert_window` urgency bucket)
- WHEN the user activates the "Next 30 days" button
- THEN the lot IS listed
- AND a lot with `days_remaining = 31` is NOT listed

#### Scenario: Negative days_remaining falls out of every range except Expired and All

- GIVEN an active lot with `days_remaining = -3`
- WHEN the user activates any of "Today", "Alert window", "Next 7 days", or "Next 30 days"
- THEN the lot is NOT listed under that filter
- AND the lot IS listed under "Expired" and under "All"

### Requirement: Dashboard preset matcher uses per-row day counts, not bucket strings

The Dashboard preset matcher MUST evaluate the row's `days_remaining` and `alert_days_before` fields. The matcher MUST NOT rely on the row's `urgency` bucket string as a filter key. Changing the classifier's bucket boundaries MUST NOT change the rows returned by any quick-filter button.

#### Scenario: matcher signature uses the enriched row, not the urgency string

- GIVEN the matcher implementation
- WHEN it is invoked during `get_dashboard` for each enriched row
- THEN it receives the enriched `DashboardLotRow` and an `Option<DashboardPreset>`
- AND it returns `true` when the row satisfies the predicate for that preset per the requirement above
- AND the result does not depend on the value of `row.urgency`

### Requirement: Dashboard urgency cards remain bucket counts

The four urgency cards on the Dashboard MUST continue to display counts derived from the row's `Urgency` classification (`Expired` / `Today` / `AlertWindow` / `Next30Days`). The card counts are independent of the quick-filter row sets and MAY differ from them.

#### Scenario: card counts are derived from the urgency bucket

- GIVEN an active lot with `days_remaining = 10` and `alert_days_before = 30` (which classifies as the `next_30_days` bucket because `alert_days_before >= 30`)
- WHEN the dashboard loads with no filter active
- THEN the "Next 30 days" card count includes this lot
- AND the "Alert window" card count does NOT include this lot
- AND activating the "Alert window" button still lists this lot because `days_remaining` is in `[0, alert_days_before]`

#### Scenario: card counts may diverge from filter row counts by design

- GIVEN active lots whose `alert_days_before >= 30` classify them as `next_30_days` even when they expire within their own window
- WHEN the dashboard loads
- THEN the "Next 30 days" card count includes those lots
- AND the "Alert window" filter row set also includes those lots
- AND the two numbers are allowed to differ; this divergence is accepted scope and is not a defect

## Capability: Local notifications

### Requirement: daily alert window notification

Caduxo shall generate local OS notifications once per day for each active lot from `expiry_date - alert_days_before` through `expiry_date`.

### Requirement: no duplicate same-day notifications

Caduxo shall record shown notifications and prevent duplicate notifications for the same lot on the same date.

### Requirement: stop after expiry date

Caduxo shall stop daily OS notifications after the expiry date, while keeping expired lots prominent in the dashboard.

## Capability: CSV import

### Requirement: simple catalog import

Caduxo shall import product catalog data from CSV with canonical fields:

- `upc`
- `sku`
- `description`

### Requirement: column mapping

Caduxo shall allow users to map CSV columns manually when the source file uses different column names.

### Requirement: import preview

Caduxo shall show an import preview with duplicate warnings before committing imported products.

## Capability: Reports

### Requirement: MVP reports

Caduxo shall provide these reports:

- in alert window
- expired
- next 30 days
- custom filtered report

### Requirement: report filters

Reports shall support filters for:

- store/local
- internal location
- category
- status
- date range

### Requirement: PDF export

Caduxo shall export reports to PDF using Rust-side structured PDF generation.

### Requirement: CSV report export

Caduxo shall export report rows to CSV.

## Capability: Data persistence and safety

### Requirement: local persistence

Caduxo shall store all MVP data in a local SQLite database.

### Requirement: offline use

Caduxo shall support normal operation without internet access.

### Requirement: backup and restore

Caduxo shall provide a manual backup/export and restore path.

### Requirement: migrations

Caduxo shall preserve existing local data across database schema migrations.

## Capability: Engineering safety

### Requirement: tests accompany implementation

Caduxo shall add or update automated tests in the same implementation slice as backend, persistence, domain, or covered frontend behavior is introduced or changed, except for documentation-only work, explicitly justified temporary scaffolding, or frontend/runtime behavior that is accepted for MVP with manual verification and tracked for a dedicated post-MVP frontend harness.

#### Scenario: behavior slice is implemented

- Given a slice introduces backend, persistence, domain, or frontend behavior covered by the current automated harness
- When the slice is prepared for review
- Then matching tests are added or updated
- And the slice notes list the test commands that were run
- And any accepted frontend/runtime manual-verification gap is recorded as a post-MVP follow-up

### Requirement: regression coverage for critical workflows

Caduxo shall maintain regression coverage for first-run setup, SKU/barcode uniqueness, lot alert calculations, partial resolution, notification deduplication, CSV import mapping, report generation, and backup/restore validation as those workflows are implemented.

### Requirement: structured local logging

Caduxo shall provide structured local application logging for backend startup, database initialization, migrations, command errors, notification checks, import/export, report generation, and backup/restore operations.

### Requirement: safe log content

Caduxo logs shall avoid sensitive business data such as product names, barcodes, SKU values, full imported file contents, and free-form notes unless a deliberate debug mode is introduced later.
