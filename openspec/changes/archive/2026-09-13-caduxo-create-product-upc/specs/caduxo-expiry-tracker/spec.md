## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: UPC attach during product creation

The product creation form MUST expose a UPC/barcode input field that allows the user to attach a barcode to a product without first creating the product and then navigating to the product detail page.

This requirement extends the existing "multiple barcodes per product" capability from after-creation only to also during-creation, while leaving the detail-page Barcodes section as the place to manage more than one barcode per product.

#### Scenario: user attaches UPC during manual product creation

- GIVEN the user is creating a product from the catalog UI in create mode
- WHEN the user enters a UPC value in the create form's Barcodes subsection
- AND submits the form
- THEN the system creates the product via `create_product` first
- AND the system attempts to attach the UPC to the created product via the post-save barcode attach step
- AND the system invokes `onSaved` exactly once once the product exists

#### Scenario: UPC field empty stays the default and quiet path

- GIVEN the user is creating a product
- WHEN the UPC field is empty or trimmed to empty
- THEN the system creates the product
- AND the system MUST NOT invoke any `add_product_barcode` command
- AND no barcode-related UI notice is rendered

#### Scenario: UPC field shape mirrors detail page

- GIVEN the create form is rendered in create mode
- THEN it MUST display a Barcodes subsection containing at minimum:
  - a "Barcode value" text input with placeholder `e.g. 7501234567890`
  - an optional "Type" text input backed by a `<datalist>` offering `EAN13`, `EAN8`, `UPC`, `CODE128`, `CODE39`, `QR`
  - an optional "Set as primary" checkbox (unchecked by default)
- AND the subsection MUST be visually consistent with the Barcodes section on the product detail page
- AND the subsection MUST NOT be rendered in edit mode

### Requirement: non-blocking barcode attach on create

The product creation submit flow MUST treat a barcode attach failure as non-blocking: the new product MUST remain saved and `onSaved` MUST be invoked regardless of the attach outcome, with attach outcomes surfaced via a non-blocking inline notice.

#### Scenario: UPC already attached to another product

- GIVEN the user submitted the create form with a non-empty UPC value
- AND the backend reports the UPC is already attached to a different product
- WHEN the post-save attach step runs
- THEN the system keeps the new product saved
- AND renders an inline notice under the Barcodes subsection stating that the UPC already belongs to another product and was not attached
- AND does not roll back the product creation
- AND does not throw

#### Scenario: UPC already attached to this product

- GIVEN the user submitted the create form with a non-empty UPC value
- AND the backend reports the UPC is already attached to the same product (defensive retry case)
- WHEN the post-save attach step runs
- THEN the system keeps the new product saved
- AND renders an inline notice with the backend message
- AND does not throw

#### Scenario: backend command error during attach

- GIVEN the user submitted the create form with a non-empty UPC value
- WHEN the post-save attach step encounters any other backend error (network, database, schema, validation)
- THEN the system keeps the new product saved
- AND renders the backend message in the inline notice slot
- AND does not roll back the product creation
- AND does not throw

### Requirement: typed barcode attach wrapper for create flow

The frontend MUST provide a wrapper around `add_product_barcode` used during product creation that returns a discriminated result instead of throwing, so the create flow can react to attach outcomes without crashing the product save.

#### Scenario: wrapper result shape on success

- GIVEN the create flow invokes the wrapper with a trimmed non-empty UPC value
- WHEN the backend `add_product_barcode` call succeeds
- THEN the wrapper returns `{ ok: true }`
- AND the wrapper MUST NOT throw

#### Scenario: wrapper result shape on duplicate against another product

- GIVEN the create flow invokes the wrapper
- WHEN the backend rejects the attach because the UPC is already attached to a different product
- THEN the wrapper returns `{ ok: false, kind: "duplicate_other" }`
- AND the wrapper MUST NOT throw
- AND the create flow renders the "already belongs to another product" notice from this result kind

#### Scenario: wrapper result shape on duplicate against the same product

- GIVEN the create flow invokes the wrapper
- WHEN the backend rejects the attach because the UPC is already attached to the same product
- THEN the wrapper returns `{ ok: false, kind: "duplicate_same" }`
- AND the wrapper MUST NOT throw

#### Scenario: wrapper result shape on any other failure

- GIVEN the create flow invokes the wrapper
- WHEN the backend reports any other error (network, database, schema, validation)
- THEN the wrapper returns `{ ok: false, kind: "other", message }` containing the backend message
- AND the wrapper MUST NOT throw

### Requirement: scanner quick-create seeds UPC field

The dashboard scan quick-create path MUST seed the scanned value into the create form's UPC/barcode field, not into the SKU field, when no product matches the scan. UPC and SKU remain independent identifiers; the user types the SKU themselves.

#### Scenario: unmatched scan opens quick-create with UPC pre-fill

- GIVEN the user scans or types a value into the dashboard scan/search field
- AND no product matches that value as a barcode or SKU
- WHEN the quick-create modal opens
- THEN the create form's UPC/barcode field is pre-filled with the scanned value
- AND the SKU field is empty
- AND the user MUST be able to submit the form with the scanned UPC and a typed SKU

#### Scenario: matched scan opens product directly

- GIVEN the user scans or types a value into the dashboard scan/search field
- AND the value matches an existing product by barcode
- WHEN the dashboard handles the scan
- THEN the matched product is opened
- AND no quick-create modal is shown
- AND no UPC attach is attempted

### Requirement: silent barcode helper retired once nothing calls it

The dashboard quick-create path MUST migrate off the silent `addProductBarcodeIfNew` helper to the new typed wrapper, and the silent helper MUST be removed once no production caller remains.

#### Scenario: dashboard quick-create uses typed wrapper

- GIVEN the dashboard opens the quick-create modal after a non-matching scan
- WHEN the create form completes a successful product save with a non-empty UPC
- THEN the form's submit flow uses the typed wrapper to attach the UPC
- AND the create form MUST NOT invoke the silent `addProductBarcodeIfNew` helper

#### Scenario: silent helper removal once obsolete

- GIVEN no production caller invokes the silent `addProductBarcodeIfNew` helper after the migration
- WHEN this change is archived
- THEN the silent helper is removed from `src/lib/products.ts`
- AND no automated test references the silent helper

## MODIFIED Requirements

None. The existing canonical requirements "multiple barcodes per product" and "barcode uniqueness" continue to describe the underlying data behavior unchanged. The new requirements above specify the additional create-time attach surface and the create-vs-detail division of responsibility for managing barcodes.

## REMOVED Requirements

None.
